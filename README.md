### Philosophy & Usage
Due to my background as a barkeeper interested in bar culture in my city as well as globally, I would have loved an application like this, hence the idea for this project. I find it fascinating to observe - or better yet, be a part of - the everchanging and evolving bar culture and community and brining people together in a "third place" (based on the philosophy to have a third place besides home and work to foster community).
Based on your location or city a bar or a selection of bars displayed as a bar tour can be searched for depending on the pre-set categories you choose. Here you come across bar related vocabulary such as "rooftop" or "speakeasy", which can be self explanatory yet also could call for a little research beforehand. Or you are in for a spontaneous and adventurous night!
Register for an account to save your favourite bars and bar tours and keep up with new bars opening up.
Try the pre-set bar tours!
And tune in for upcoming developments.
Until further versions, Vienna will be the only city available.
